CakePHP Asset Plugin
====================

The idea of this plugin is to improve CakePHP's assets management,
including:

* manage multiple assets servers;
* image thumbnailing;
* Conditional GET

It lacks lots and lots of things at the moment, but I'm planning to
add features as regular as possible.

What is Conditional GET?
------------------------

Conditional GET is the ability to save bandwidth when re-requesting a
resource served by a HTTP server. This translates into a pair of
headers sent by the server when accessing a resource for the first
time, especifically, Last-Modified and ETag. The web browser then,
when request the same resource, can ask If-Modified-Since or
If-None-Match, in order to ask the server if the resource has been
modified or not since the last time. If it wasn't, the server answers
with a 304 Not Modified header, which tells the browser to use the
cached image.

None of the frameworks I'm aware of (such as CakePHP or Ruby on Rails)
manage this type of BASIC caching, which is not only a shame but a
lame move. Hopefully I'll deploy a simple way to add this to your
CakePHP applications.
